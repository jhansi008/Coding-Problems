# [C++ Strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/c-strings4609/1)
## Easy
Given two strings&nbsp; S1 and S2 .&nbsp;You have to concatenate both the strings and print the concatenated string.

Example 1:

Input:
S1 = "Geeksfor"
S2 = "Geeks"
Output: GeeksforGeeks
Explanation: Combined "Geeksfor" and "Geeks"

&nbsp;

Example 2:

Input:
S1 = "Practice"
S2 = "Hard"
Output: PracticeHard
Explanation: Combined "Practice" and "Hard"

&nbsp;

Your Task: &nbsp;
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function conCat()&nbsp;which accepts two strings S1 and S2 as input parameter and returns concatenated string.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S1| + |S2|) .
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S1| + |S2|) .
where N is the length of a&nbsp;String


Constraints:
1 &lt;= |S1| , |S2|&nbsp;&lt;= 105
|S| denotes the length of the string S.
